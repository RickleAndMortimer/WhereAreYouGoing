			<h2 class="section-header">About</h2>
				<p>This website provides users with an interactive map of where people say they are. A user can, anonymously, input that they will be at a specified location and other users can see on a map that people will be there. This can help to disincentivize people from going to places that they will know will be crowded. People may be convinced to spread out and to go to other stores, restaurants, etc. if they know few people are there. </p>
			<hr/>
			<h2 class="section-header">How to Use</h2>
				<p>Users schedule events through the Scheduler tab and view locations on the map through the Map Viewer tab. Personal information will not be asked for, aside from the amount of people accompanying their ventures and the location they're heading towards</p>

			<h2 class="section-header">The Goal</h2>
				<p>We hope this app will be used as a tool for people to collaborate and regulate the amount of people in an establishment within a certain time.
				Huge population counts within establishments induce a higher chance of an individual contracting COVID-19. Giving users the tool to view the amount of people
				will prevent establishments from overcrowding, which will in turn prevent COVID-19 cases.</p>
